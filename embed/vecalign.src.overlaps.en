You should ensure that your routine (childhood) immunizations, such as tetanus, diphtheria, polio and measles, are up-to-date. PHAC reports that malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, polio and measles are present in Angola. Take precautions against contracting water-borne diseases. Water used for consumption (including water used to make ice cubes) should first be boiled or otherwise sterilized. Be cautious of eating non-peelable raw fruit and vegetables due to the possibility of cholera, typhoid and hepatitis. As the level of HIV/AIDS infection in Angola is high, you should be careful about activities involving the transmission of bodily fluids.
